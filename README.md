# Rubik-s-Cube
This project was our final homework of Matlab. 李子天,马梓航,宋誉卓，吕笳赈 finished it together.
We use Matlab to depict images of Rubik's Cube in 3D, and show the process of reset.
It's hard to describe what we did in detail. 
Download all the  file, open them in matlab, run ParentWindow.m, then you will know what we did.
If you have some questions, you can look for answer in GithubReport.doc.
If you find some bugs while running it, please contact me.
